- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- Show in the status bar how many servers didn't reply during a refresh.  ASE
  doesn't do that, so you need to turn off the filters to see if everything is
  ok, or if there was a connection problem etc.

- Use Integer.parse instead of toInt to avoid exceptions?  parse will just
  return 0 if there's garbage in the string, which is usually better than
  stopping the app with an exception.  Might also speed up sorting.
