- Add a menu with Specify, Settings, etc?  And some icons.

- Check out qstat's option to use Gamespy masters.

- Check out more qstat parameters, like sendinterval, timeout and interval.

- Display the number of human players in the status bar?

- Save window position between sessions.

- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- If loading servers without refreshing the GUI, there is no point in calling
  _insertSorted, or to get country codes.

- Use Integer.parse instead of toInt to avoid exceptions?  parse will just
  return 0 if there's garbage in the string, which is usually better than
  stopping the app with an exception.  Might also speed up sorting.

- Don't select (mark) a server twice (Specify server).
