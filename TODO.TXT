- Player names with color codes are sorted wrong.

- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- Show in the status bar how many servers didn't reply during a refresh.  ASE
  doesn't do that, so you need to turn off the filters to see if everything is
  ok, or if there was a connection problem etc.

- Use Integer.parse instead of toInt to avoid exceptions?  parse will just
  return 0 if there's garbage in the string, which is usually better than
  stopping the app with an exception.  Might also speed up sorting.

- tango.text.convert.TimeStamp always outputs GMT (used for LOG.TXT).

- DMD doesn't generate docs for all files, including serverlist.d.

- The compile-*.bat files don't work anymore.  Is there any point in keeping
  them around?  They're only needed if Bud/Build somehow is not available.
