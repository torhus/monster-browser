- Display the number of human players in the status bar?

- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- If loading servers without refreshing the GUI, there is no point in calling
  _insertSorted, or to get country codes.

- Use Integer.parse instead of toInt to avoid exceptions?  parse will just
  return 0 if there's garbage in the string, which is usually better than
  stopping the app with an exception.  Might also speed up sorting.

- Avoid reallocation when serverList.list gets filled.  Either by
  pre-allocating, or by switching to a linked list.  This could also reduce
  memory use.  Could also have a look at GC.minimize().

- Don't select (mark) a server twice (Specify server).
