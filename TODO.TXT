- Verify that server passwords still work.

- Add max timeout count (3?) so I get some time to test it.

- Complete threading for rcon.

- Tab completion for rcon commands, at least fix tab order.

- Don't ask for password in rcon if already known.  Ask for a new password
  if the server returns "Bad rconpassword.".

- Colored text in rcon output?

- Server count in status bar is wrong after deleting a server.

- Don't display "There was no reply" when refreshing selected servers.

- How does 'Never remove this server automatically' relate to automatic hiding
  of servers with too high timeout count?

- Remove old passwords when changing them without saving the new one?

- Reconcile ServerTable.quickRefresh and fullRefresh, also look into unifying
  selection keeping code.

- Ability to change persistence state of manually added servers by adding them
  again?

- Change taskbar text when working, to keep user informed?

- See if ServerData.customData really is needed, cache TextLayouts in
  ServerTable instead if there is a noticable speedup?

- Display better message when aborting Check for new servers.

- When interrupting a check for new servers, the press of Refresh all won't
  query the servers the were not tried already.

- Don't save xml files when using gslist?

- Fix the name of extra servers files, use game or mod name, maybe a
  customizable name?

- Number of removed servers printed by getNewList() is wrong when extra servers
  are being used.

- Check out qstat's option to use Gamespy masters.

- Check out more qstat parameters, like sendinterval, timeout and interval.

- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- If loading servers without refreshing the GUI, there is no point in calling
  _insertSorted, or to get country codes.

- Don't select (mark) a server twice (Specify server).
