- Save separate list with just baseq3 servers?

- Don't query all servers for baseq3.

- ServerList._insertSorted() doesn't always sort right.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- Show in the status bar how many servers didn't reply during a refresh.  ASE
  doesn't do that, so you need to turn off the filters to see if everything is
  ok, or if there was a connection problem etc.

- Keep the same server(s) selected when new servers are added to the list during
  a refresh.
  - Could maybe have ServerTable save a list of pointers to the ServerData
    structs for the currently selected servers, and then add a function to
    ServerList that returns the index of the server in filteredList, based on
    the pointer, or address field of the server.

- DMD doesn't generate docs for all files, including serverlist.d.

- The compile-*.bat files don't work anymore.  Is there any point in keeping
  them around?  They're only needed if Build somehow is not available.
