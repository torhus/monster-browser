- Make it work with the new World of Padman master, master.kickchat.com.

- Fix baseq3 server list when using gslist.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- Show in the status bar how many servers didn't reply during a refresh.  ASE
  doesn't do that, so you need to turn off the filters to see if everything is
  ok, or if there was a connection problem etc.

- DMD doesn't generate docs for all files, including serverlist.d.

- The compile-*.bat files don't work anymore.  Is there any point in keeping
  them around?  They're only needed if Bud/Build somehow is not available.
