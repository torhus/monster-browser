[01:28]	<Aelf>	btw -- it would be nice to be able to follow a teamgame (color the player's lines according to the team they are in -> red or blue --- and another field where it shows red and blue score)
[01:29]	<Aelf>	that's actually the only feature i am missing in monsterbrowser right now
[01:30]	<Aelf>	in qxmon it looks like this e.g. : http://www.qxmon.net/q3mon-spy.pl?91.121.106.200:7777

- clear tables when the active game has been deleted from the dropdown, since
  many actions will cause a crash, like changing filters

- should optimize countHumanPlayers?  Profile it.

- When interrupting a check for new servers, the press of Refresh all won't
  query the servers the were not tried already.

- Tab completion for rcon commands, or at least fix tab traversal order.

- Colored text in rcon output?

- How does 'Never remove this server automatically' relate to automatic hiding
  of servers with too high timeout count?

- Remove old passwords when changing them without saving the new one?

- Reconcile ServerTable.quickRefresh and fullRefresh, also look into unifying
  selection keeping code.

- Ability to change persistence state of manually added servers by adding them
  again?

- Change taskbar text when working, to keep user informed?

- See if ServerData.customData really is needed, cache TextLayouts in
  ServerTable instead if there is a noticable speedup?

- Fix the name of extra servers files, use game or mod name, maybe a
  customizable name?

- Number of removed servers printed by getNewList() is wrong when extra servers
  are being used.

- Check out qstat's option to use Gamespy masters.

- Check out more qstat parameters, like sendinterval, timeout and interval.

- Implement some kind of server monitoring.

- Give sensible errors messages in case of connection problems etc.

- If loading servers without refreshing the GUI, there is no point in calling
  _insertSorted, or to get country codes.

- Don't select (mark) a server twice (Specify server).
