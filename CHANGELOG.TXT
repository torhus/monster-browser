v0.1 - 2006-07-12
-----------------
- Initial release.

v0.2 - 2006-10-16
-----------------
- New: Show which servers are passworded.
- New: Save passwords in the settings file.
- Change: Don't show join dialog for servers that don't require a password.
- Change: Remember which server was selected when it's filtered out, reselect when it's not filtered out anymore.
- Fix: Don't show players or cvars for a server that is not selected, or for the wrong server.

v0.3 - 2007-05-05
-----------------
- New: Doesn't get a new list when switching mods, just does a refresh instead.
       If the mod has been refreshed already , it just displays the list without refreshing.
       This makes it a lot faster to check the server lists for more than one mod.
- New: Selection marker stays on the selected server when recieving servers.
- New: Server list and player list sorts are now stable (ie. multiple column sorting works again).
- Fix: Shouldn't hang when querying servers or when exiting the program anymore.
- Fix: The server table flashes a bit less when recieving servers.
- Fix: Servers get added to the list much faster, not taking network slowness into consideration.
