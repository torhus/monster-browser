Latest changes
--------------
- New: Remote console (rcon).
- New: When multiple servers are selected, you can place the mouse pointer over
       a player name to get a tool tip showing the server name.  Double click a
       player to select the server he's on.
- New: Show the total number of human players for the current game.
- New: Servers that time out three times in a row are automatically removed.
- New: Ability to manually remove servers from the list.
- Change: Set player count to zero for servers that timed out, so they don't
          show up when filters are enabled.
- Change: Manually added servers are no longer saved to the *.extra files, only
          to the master server files.  Servers found in the *.extra files are
          still queried.
- Change: Don't show passwords when typing them.
- Fix: More responsive in some cases, due to switching to a customized qstat.
       Also makes the status bar counter keep getting updated even when lots of
       servers time out.
- Fix: Servers that timed out were not displayed if their game and mod names
       differed.
- Fix: Would sometimes crash when switching to another game after changing
       filters.
- Fix: More robust against errors in settings.ini, in the XML files, and in
       data received from servers.
- Fix: Would crash if you typed a game name into the combo box that was the
       last game selected before shutdown, but didn't exist in mods.ini.


v0.5 - 2009-05-16
-----------------
The "Get new list" button was renamed to "Check for new".  It does no longer
cause Monster Browser to dump the servers it already knows about and start from
scratch.  Instead it makes MB synchronize itself with the master server,
removing servers that are gone, and adding new ones.  The servers that were
already known to run the right game/mod are not requeried, but all the rest
are.

The "Refresh list" button was renamed to "Refresh all".  It works like before,
except for one thing.  The first time you press it after doing a "Check for
new", it will retry any servers that timed out during that operation.  This
should increase the chance of getting all relevant servers.

Other changes:

- New: Button icons.
- New: Restore previous window position.
- New: A setting for how many servers to query simultaneously.  You can lower
       this if you get too many timeouts, to see if it helps.
- Change: Display servers that timed out, showing an infinity sign in the ping
          column.

------------------
- New: Added default settings and game type names for Smokin' Guns.
- New: Added support for Tremulous.
- New: Added "regKey" and "exeName" keys to the game configuration, to support
       getting the install path from the registry.
- New: Added "mod" and "protocolVersion" keys to the game configuration.
- New: Can now press F4 to get a new list, F5 to refresh.
- New: Can now press Esc to interrupt operations.
- Change: Made name colors darker for better readability.
- Fix: Installer didn't create shortcuts by default.

v0.4a - 2008-08-01

- New: Display an error message if the game's executable was not found when
       attempting to join a server.
- New: Added an ugly application icon.

v0.3 - 2007-05-18
------------------
- New: Custom master server and executable for each mod.  Check out mods.ini.
- New: Don't get a new list when switching mods, just do a refresh instead.
       If the mod has been refreshed already, just display the list without refreshing.
       This makes it a lot faster to check the server lists for more than one mod.
- New: Selection marker stays on the selected server when recieving servers.

-----------------
- Initial release.
