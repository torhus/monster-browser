v0.3b - 2007-06-02
------------------
- Fix: 'Get new list' included too many servers, corrected to behave the same as 'Refresh list'.

v0.3a - 2007-05-20
------------------
- Fix: Filters didn't always work when doing a refresh.

v0.3 - 2007-05-18
------------------
- New: Custom master server and executable for each mod.  Check out mods.ini.
- New: Don't get a new list when switching mods, just do a refresh instead.
       If the mod has been refreshed already, just display the list without refreshing.
       This makes it a lot faster to check the server lists for more than one mod.
- New: Selection marker stays on the selected server when recieving servers.
- New: Server list and player list sorts are now stable (ie. multiple column sorting works again).
- Fix: Get more servers for some mods, like InstaUnlagged and OSP.
- Fix: Shouldn't hang when querying servers or when exiting the program anymore.
- Fix: The server table flashes a bit less when recieving servers.
- Fix: Servers get added to the list much faster, not taking network slowness into consideration.

-----------------
- New: Show which servers are passworded.
- New: Save passwords in the settings file.
- Change: Don't show join dialog for servers that don't require a password.
- Change: Remember which server was selected when it's filtered out, reselect when it's not filtered out anymore.
- Fix: Don't show players or cvars for a server that is not selected, or for the wrong server.
