Work in progress
----------------
- Change: Files with extra servers are now looked for in the settings and data
          folder instead of the installation folder. This folder is easily
          accessible through the Tools menu, and, unlike the installation
          folder, is not write protected. This does not affect portable
          installations.
- Change: mods-default.ini is now created on first startup after installation
          or upgrade, instead of being included in the installer. This should
          work better when multiple user accounts are involved. It is still
          included in the ZIP package.
- Fix: The name column is no longer highlighted in dark blue for selected
       servers or players.

          server count. Quake 3 and its mods are now at the top.
- Change: The game drop-down lists up to 25 entries without adding scroll bars.
- Change: Hardcoded game type names for OSP and westernq3 removed, use the
          gameType setting in mods.ini instead.
- Change: When there is no gametype cvar for a server the game type column will
          be empty instead instead of containing "???". This is meant to make
          the server list for Tremulous look a bit cleaner.

v0.9h - 2022-10-28
------------------
- New: Status bar tool tip that shows master server name and server count.

- Change: Updated configurations for Tremulous and Urban Terror. Configuration
          for Reaction was removed.
- Change: If mod is set to nothing, extra servers are loaded from
          <section name>.extra, as opposed to <mod>.extra.
- Change: QStat is updated to version 2.17.
- Change: Updated installer that won't add anything to per-user directories.
- Fix: Updated the MaxMind DB DLL to 1.6.0, this makes location information
       work when MB is installed in a path with non-ASCII characters.

v0.9d - 2019-04-24

       for the first time.  The default is to refresh the list, like before.
- New: Added default settings for Urban Terror 4.2.
- New: Support non-ASCII characters in settings.ini and mods.ini.
- Change: Set fs_game based on the server's game cvar when launching the game,
          not on the mod setting from mods.ini.

          Check the file modification time to know.

          master.

v0.7 - 2010-04-05
-----------------
- New: Improved status bar.
- New: Can now use .bat or .lnk files instead of an .exe when launching a game.
- Change: Settings and data are now stored in a user-specific location, instead
  of the installation folder.  The installer will move your files to this
  location so you don't lose your current settings or server lists.
  If you want to keep it all in one directory, create an empty file called
  'portable.txt' in the directory where MonsterBrowser.exe is located.
- Change: The key for opening a remote console window is now F9, as F10 is the
  standard key for opening the menu on Windows.  F10 will still work, at least
  in this version.

  properly.

-----------------
- New: Remote console (rcon).

       a player name to get a tool tip showing the server name.  Double click a
       player to select the server he's on.

       servers.
- New: Servers that time out more than three times in a row are automatically
       removed.
- New: Ability to manually remove servers from the list.
- Change: Set player count to zero for servers that timed out, so they don't
          show up when filters are enabled.
- Change: Don't ask for a password if one is already set.
- Change: Don't ask for password for a server with reserved slots, can set the
          password through the right-click menu instead.
- Change: Manually added servers are no longer saved to the *.extra files, only
          to the master server files.  Servers found in the *.extra files are
          still queried.
- Change: Don't show passwords when typing them.
- Fix: More responsive in some cases, due to switching to a customized qstat.
       Also makes the status bar counter keep getting updated even when lots of
       servers time out.
- Fix: Servers that timed out were not displayed if their game and mod names
       differed.

       filters.

       data received from servers.
- Fix: Would crash if you typed a game name into the combo box that was the
       last game selected before shutdown, but didn't exist in mods.ini.


v0.5 - 2009-05-16
-----------------
The "Get new list" button was renamed to "Check for new".  It does no longer
cause Monster Browser to dump the servers it already knows about and start from
scratch.  Instead it makes MB synchronize itself with the master server,
removing servers that are gone, and adding new ones.  The servers that were
already known to run the right game/mod are not requeried, but all the rest
are.

The "Refresh list" button was renamed to "Refresh all".  It works like before,
except for one thing.  The first time you press it after doing a "Check for
new", it will retry any servers that timed out during that operation.  This
should increase the chance of getting all relevant servers.

Other changes:

- New: Button icons.
- New: Restore previous window position.
- New: A setting for how many servers to query simultaneously.  You can lower
       this if you get too many timeouts, to see if it helps.
- Change: Display servers that timed out, showing an infinity sign in the ping
          column.


v0.4b - 2009-02-01
------------------
- New: Added default settings and game type names for Smokin' Guns.

- New: Display an error message if the game's executable was not found when
       attempting to join a server.
- New: Added an ugly application icon.

       are included in the total number of servers.

v0.3a - 2007-05-20
------------------
- Fix: Filters didn't always work when doing a refresh.

v0.3 - 2007-05-18
------------------
- New: Custom master server and executable for each mod.  Check out mods.ini.
- New: Don't get a new list when switching mods, just do a refresh instead.
       If the mod has been refreshed already, just display the list without refreshing.
       This makes it a lot faster to check the server lists for more than one mod.
- New: Selection marker stays on the selected server when recieving servers.

-----------------
- Initial release.
