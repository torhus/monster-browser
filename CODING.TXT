This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++, Java, and C#.

DWT  GUI library (included in the source download):

There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com.
The included version works with dmd 1.017 and Build 3.04, the official version
doesn't.

DWT is a D port of IBM's SWT for Java.  Unfortunately, it still only runs on
Windows.  I'm hoping that someone will start working on Linux and Mac ports
sometime.  But as of October 2007, the project seems to be dead.  However,
another SWT port (dsource.org/projects/tioport) is in the works.

DWT is based on SWT 3.0.  However, some of the 3.1 API also seems to be
implemented.

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.


Please feel free to clean up my code if you like.  It was coded in a very
ad hoc, step by step way, so the code organization is a bit random in some
places.  Sorry about that.
