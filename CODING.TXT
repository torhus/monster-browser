This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

Version IDs
-----------
allservers - for benchmarking, often in combination with the 'fromfile' command
             line argument.
Final      - Use the real version number for release builds
             (common.FINAL_VERSION).
NO_STDOUT  - Currently broken, used to cause stdout to be redirected to the
             file STDOUT.TXT.
build      - Used by the bud and dsss/rebuild build tools.


-----------
Two external programs are used, the first one is optional and not included in
the download:

Please be aware that gslist is subject to some legal controversy, please read

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.


Please feel free to clean up my code if you like.  It was coded in a very
ad hoc, step by step way, so the code organization is a bit random in some
places.  Sorry about that.
