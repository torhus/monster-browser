This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

Libraries used
--------------
Tango, currently svn revision 4498:
http://dsource.org/projects/tango/

ini.d (included in the source download):
http://www.dprogramming.com/ini.php

DWT GUI library. DWT is a D port of IBM's SWT 3.4.1 for Java.
Revision used with this project is currently 338 on Windows.
http://www.dsource.org/projects/dwt
http://help.eclipse.org/help32/nftopic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/package-tree.html
There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com, and a #dwt channel on
freenode (IRC).


Building on Windows
-------------------
- download the correct revision of dwt-win, see above.
- in the top level dir, run 'dsss build -release -O'.  That should create
  DD-dwt.lib.
- run 'dsss build --debug -g', which creates debug-DD-dwt.lib.
- Copy those two files into the directory where you checked out Monster
  Browser.  Also copy the 'dwt' and 'res' directories.
- Unzip http://monsterbrowser.googlecode.com/files/monsterbrowser_flags.zip
  into the Monster Browser directory.
- Run build-release.bat or one of the other batch files.  Requires bud to be
  installed, see above.


Building on Linux
-----------------
This hasn't been tested for some time, but the dsss.conf file that is included
might still work.  It can be used to build Monster Browser without building
DWT as a library first.  See the instructions for building on Windows.


Version IDs
-----------
allservers - For benchmarking: don't filter servers on mod.
build      - Used by the bud and dsss/rebuild build tools.
Final      - Use the real version number for release builds
             (common.FINAL_VERSION).
redirect   - Redirect stdout and stderr (Cout and Cerr) to the file DEBUG.OUT.


Command line arguments (for testing/benchmarking)
-------------------------------------------------
dumplist  - Dump the list of addresses given to qstat to refreshlist.tmp.
dumpqstat - Dump qstat's raw output to qstat.out.
fromfile  - Get servers from disk instead of through the network.
norefresh - Don't refresh the server table GUI while receiving servers.
quit      - Print time since startup and then quit, after loading the server
            list from disk.


-----------
Two external programs are used, the first one is optional and not included in
the download:
http://directory.fsf.org/All_Packages_in_Directory/gslist.html
http://qstat.org/

Please be aware that gslist is subject to some legal controversy, please read

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.
