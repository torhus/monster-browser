This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

DWT GUI library. DWT is a D port of IBM's SWT 3.4.1 for Java.
I'm currently using dwt-win r341 on Windows.

There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com, and a #dwt channel on
freenode (IRC).


Building on Windows
-------------------
- Download dwt-win, see above.
- Copy the 'res' directory from DWT into the Monster Browser directory.
- Also copy the 'dwt' directory, either into the Monster Browser directory, or
  into your D import directory.
- Run build-release.bat or one of the other batch files.  Requires xfBuild to
  be installed, see above.


Building on Linux
-----------------
This hasn't been tested for some time, but the dsss.conf file that is included
might still work.  It can be used to build Monster Browser without building
DWT as a library first.  See the instructions for building on Windows.


Version IDs
-----------
allservers - For benchmarking: don't filter servers on mod.
build      - Used by the bud and dsss/rebuild build tools.
Final      - Use the real version number for release builds
             (common.FINAL_VERSION).
console    - Enable console output.  Logging will be done both to the console
             and the log file.
redirect   - Redirect stdout and stderr (Cout and Cerr) to the file
             CONSOLE.OUT.


Command line arguments (for testing/benchmarking)
-------------------------------------------------
dumplist  - Dump the list of addresses given to qstat to refreshlist.tmp.
dumpqstat - Dump qstat's raw output to qstat.out.
fromfile  - Get servers from disk instead of through the network.
norefresh - Don't refresh the server table GUI while receiving servers.
quit      - Print time since startup and then quit, after loading the server
            list from disk.

Two external programs are used, the second one is optional and not included in
the download:
