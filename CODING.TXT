This program is coded in the Digital Mars D language.  It should be easy to
pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

------------
D compiler:
http://ftp.digitalmars.com/dmd.1.00.zip
Versions >= 0.174 should work, latest known to work is 1.0.  Versions 1.004 and
1.005 do not work with DWT.  I haven't tested 1.001-1.003, but you should stay
away from them in any case, they are too buggy.

Later versions than 2.10 currently don't work for this project.

ini.d (included in the source download):

DWT  GUI library (included in the source download):

There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com.
The included version works with dmd 1.0 and Build 3.04, the official version
doesn't (as of February 6 2007).

DWT is a D port of IBM's SWT for Java.  Unfortunately, it still only runs on
Windows.  I'm hoping that someone will start working on Linux and Mac ports
sometime.  But as of February 2007, the project seems to be dead. :(

DWT is based on SWT 3.0.  However, some of the 3.1 API also seems to be
implemented.


-----------
Two external programs are used, the first one is optional and not included in
the download:

Please be aware that gslist is subject to some legal controversy, please read
this link before redistributing it from a US server:

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.


Please feel free to clean up my code if you like.  It was coded in a very
ad hoc, step by step way, so the code organization is a bit random in some
places.
