This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

Version 0.75 is known to work.


Libraries used
--------------
ini.d (included in the source download):
http://www.dprogramming.com/ini.php

DWT GUI library. DWT is a D port of IBM's SWT 3.4.1 for Java.

There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com, and a #dwt channel on
freenode (IRC).


Building on Windows
-------------------
dub build --arch=x86


Building on Linux
-----------------
FIXME


Version IDs
-----------
allservers - For benchmarking: don't filter servers on mod.
build      - Used by the bud and dsss/rebuild build tools.
Final      - Use the real version number for release builds
             (common.FINAL_VERSION).
console    - Enable console output.  Logging will be done both to the console
             and the log file.
redirect   - Redirect stdout and stderr to the file CONSOLE.OUT.


Command line arguments (for testing/benchmarking)
-------------------------------------------------
dumplist  - Dump the list of addresses given to qstat to refreshlist.tmp.
dumpqstat - Dump qstat's raw output to qstat.out.
fromfile  - Get servers from disk instead of through the network.
norefresh - Don't refresh the server table GUI while receiving servers.
quit      - Print time since startup and then quit, after loading the server
            list from disk.


-----------
Two external programs are used, the first one is optional and not included in
the download:

Please be aware that gslist is subject to some legal controversy, please read

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.
