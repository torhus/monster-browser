This program is written in the Digital Mars D programming language.  It should
be easy to pick up, due to its similarity to C/C++ and Java.

There's also a DWT news group on news.digitalmars.com, and a #dwt channel on
freenode (IRC).


Version IDs
-----------
allservers - For benchmarking: don't filter servers on mod.
build      - Used by the bud and dsss/rebuild build tools.
Final      - Use the real version number for release builds
             (common.FINAL_VERSION).
redirect   - Redirect stdout and stderr (Cout and Cerr) to the file DEBUG.OUT.


Command line arguments (for testing/benchmarking)
-------------------------------------------------
fromfile  - Get servers from disk instead of through the network.
norefresh - Don't refresh the server table GUI while receiving servers.
quit      - Print time since startup and then quit, after loading the server
            list from disk.  Only works in combination with 'fromfile'.


-----------
Two external programs are used, the first one is optional and not included in
the download:

http://qstat.org/

Please be aware that gslist is subject to some legal controversy, please read
this link before redistributing it from a US server:

PathfinderET is also included, as a source of ideas for this project.


Please feel free to clean up my code if you like.  It was coded in a very
ad hoc, step by step way, so the code organization is a bit random in some
places.  Sorry about that.
